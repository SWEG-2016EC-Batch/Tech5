# Algorithm
## pseudocode
1. START
2. DECLARE capacity, milesPerGallon, totalMiles AS FLOAT
3. print 
>Enter the capacity of the fuel tank in gallons: 
4. read capacity
5. print 
>Enter the miles per gallon the automobile can drive: 
6. read milesPerGallon
7. calculat total Miles as capacity times milespergallon or `totalMiles = capacity * milesPerGallon`
8. print totalMiles 
9. END
